        Sass is a CSS pre-processor.

        Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time.
        
        What is Sass?
        
        Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet
        Sass is an extension to CSS
        Sass is a CSS pre-processor
        Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS
        Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time
        Sass was designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum in 2006
        Sass is free to download and use


        Why Use Sass?
        
        Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a CSS pre-processor can help.
        
        Sass lets you use features that do not exist in CSS, like variables, nested rules, mixins, imports, inheritance,
        built-in functions, and other stuff.

        The benefit of SASS is for example you define a color as a variable and use 
        this variable wherever you want.

        Ionic uses SASS.
        The main core of Bootstrap is also based on SASS.

        The output of a SASS program is a css file.

        The next generation of SASS is SCSS and it is a little better.

        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <pre>
        System Requirements for Sass:
            
        Operating system - Sass is platform independent
        Browser support - Sass works in Edge/IE (from IE 8), Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera
        Programming language - Sass is based on Ruby.

        SASS is a pre-processor language that compiles to a css file.

        SASS is available as a Node.js package so you can install it using NPM package manager.

        Official Website: https://sass-lang.com/

        Follow the instructions of bellow image to install SASS.

        <a href="./assets/SASS_installation_1.png">Complete installation Guide</a>
        
        <b>First Option: Using Node.js.</b>

        First of all you should install Node.js from nodejs.com
        
        If you have Node.js installed on your system simply install SASS using: CMD/Terminal>>(sudo) npm install -g sass

        then to make sure it is installed type CMD>> sass --version or >> sass --help

        How to connect css and scss files of our project?

        <a href="./text_files/SASS_installation_2.txt">SASS_installation_2.txt</a>
        
        <b>Second Option: Using Live Sass Compiler extension</b>

        We can use this extension for VScode .
        it adds a button to the status bar of vscode and it compiles the sass codes immediately.
        it connects the files together too.

        By default it saves the compiled file in the same folder of sass files.
        You should change the setting of the extension.

        <h2>Sass Variables</h2>
        <pre>

            Variables are a way to store information that you can re-use later.
            
            With Sass, you can store information in variables, like:
            
            strings, numbers, colors, booleans, lists, nulls
            
            Sass uses the $ symbol, followed by a name, to declare variables:
            
            $variable_name: value;

        <h2>SASS Variable Scope</h2>
        <pre>
        We define sass variables at the beginning of the scss file.
        This way those variables are known to all the {} spaces inside the file.

        If a variables is defined inside one of the {} spaces it is only known there 
        unless use !global after it like:
        {$myColor: green !global}

    <div id="sass-nesting-1">
        <h2>SASS Nesting</h2>
        <pre>
        In SASS we can have nested brackets.
        Using nesting gives us a better management of our stylesheet.
        Remember that you should use & before events when using nesting.

        Also we can shorten the name of properties like below example.

        <a href="./HTML_files/Nesting_Example_1.html">Nesting_Example_1.html</a>
        <a href="./scss/Nesting_Example_1.scss">Nesting_Example_1.scss</a>

    <div id="sass-mixin-1">
        <h2>SASS Mixin</h2>
        <pre>
        When we want to pack some css code and avoid retyping the we use mixins.
        Mixins are like variables but they are more strong.

        To define a mixin use @ sigh like: @mixin mixin_name{}
        To use it inside sass file use bellow structure:
        @include mixin_name();

        Include a mixin on the top of all the other properties
        in order to you be able to overwrite them.

        <a href="./HTML_files/Mixin_Example_1.html">Mixin_Example_1.html</a>
        <a href="./scss/Mixin_Example_1.scss">Mixin_Example_1.scss</a>
        <a href="./css/Mixin_Example_1.css">Mixin_Example_1.css</a>
        
        Tip: Hyphens and underscores are considered to be the same. This means that
        @mixin important-text { } and @mixin important_text { } are considered as the same mixin!

        A mixin can also include other mixins:
        
        @mixin special-text {
        @include important-text;
        @include link;
        @include special-border;
        }
        
        </pre>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div id="sass-mixin-2">
        <h2>SASS Mixin 2</h2>
        <pre>
        A mixin can act like a function because of having ().
        A mixin does not necessarily have ().
