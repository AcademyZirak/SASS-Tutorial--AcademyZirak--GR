How to connect css and scss files of our project?

first of all install node.js (node.js.com)

then install sass using npm package manager of node.js

>> nmp install -g sass

>> sass --version

 now you can convert sass files to css files using sass command using following structure

 if we use below command if gives us the transpiled code right in the terminal

 >> sass file_name.scss

 If we want sass command to give us an output we should use below structure

 >> sass the-address_of_scss_file the_address_of_output

 >> sass ./Example_1.scss ../css/Example_1.css


 This method just compiles our files and it does not connect them to each other

Use below structure for connecting them(-w = being under watch)

>> sass a.scss a.css -w

There is another way to connect the files together 
Go to next file
