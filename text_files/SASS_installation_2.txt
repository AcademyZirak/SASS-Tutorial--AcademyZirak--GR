
Using package.json to connect scss and css files

if we have a project it is recommended to use npm abilities to have a package.json 
file for our project that holds information about our project

>> npm init 

This command asks some questions and makes a package.json file for us.
if we want to ask no questions :

>> npm init --yes


Open the file that is created 

in the scripts section you can write any command to be executed 

We make a new command and name it sassWatch like below then when working with the 
project just write in the terminal :

// consider that addresses are relative to the package.json file

>> npm run sassWatch
