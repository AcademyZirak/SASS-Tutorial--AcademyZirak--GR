
First of all install Live Sass Compiler

then open the setting of vscode 

type live sass compiler 

in the section of format setting of the extension 

change the location from null to "./css/" like below:
if it is null the location will be tha same folder as the sass file.
if it does not work properly leave it to be null.

It is a little tricky.

{
      "format": "expanded",
      "extensionName": ".css",
      "savePath":null
    }


change null to "/css/"

if you change expanded to compressed then you should change extensionName to min.css
